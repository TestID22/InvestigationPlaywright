Here I am going to work with Playwright Framework. 
Goals/AIMs
1) Figure out - how Playwright works 
2) Check Settings 

Preconditions: It's good to use PW with Pytest (pip install pytest)

1) How to install Playwright:
To download and install Platwright you should use folowing commands:  
- pip install playwright

This command will download and install the necessary browser binaries for all three browsers: 
- playwright install

Alterantively, You can install specific browsers If You don't need all of them 
- playwright install chromium

2) p.chromium.lunch(headless=False) - to remove headless mode in playwright
